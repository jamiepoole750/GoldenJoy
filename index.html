                <h1>The Spark</h1>
                <p>Both sets of my grandparents are in their late 80s/early 90s and up until recently lived indepedently and quite far from myself or other relatives. While they have since moved closer to family, they still don't want to hand over their independence by moving into assisted living or a retirement home, and who could blame them. Over the years, I have become more aware of the challenges they face with complete simple tasks whether it dusting or challenges with technology. </p>
                <p>While this is not an uncommon occurrance, it caused me to think about how there could be a way to have their local commmunity offer help, leading me down the path of how to involve younger generations like high school or college students, and ultimately reenforecd the overarching theme of this project Intergenerational Connections.</p>

    <div class="problem-statement">
        <h1>As people grow older,</h1>
        
        <h5>what were once simple tasks become more time-consuming and more difficult to complete. Unfortunately, friends and family members aren't always readily available or within driving distance to help as much as they would like. Ultimately, this opens the door for the opportunity to grow and strength intergenerational relationships by leaning on the support of younger members of local communities such as high school and college students, to assist with tasks like house or yard work, technological needs, or running errands.</h5>

        <h4>With such a generational divide, how can younger generations connect with older adults to assist them with tasks, enabling them to retain their independence while also increasing community involvement?</h4>

    <div class="research">
        <h1> Initial Research</h1>
        <h2>What are intergenerational connections? And why are they relevant?</h2>
        <div class="research-benefits">
            <div class="research-data">
                <h3>Strength Community Relationships</h3>
                <p>The basic idea of intergenerational connections revolves around building relationships with people of a different age group then yourself. With this type of connection, people are actively taking the time to build connections in their communities with groups that they might not have much interaction with otherwise. In terms of this project, there is not much overlap between 18-23 years old and those who are 60+ years old.</p>
                <h3>Never Stop Learning</h3>
                <p>There are also social, political, and economoic impacts that commonly create divides between generations. But by removing that precedent it creates space for more inclusive practices to grow within local communities as people look beyond to see there is one seamlessly simple similarity. The personal skills and knowledge people within each generation have. Everyone has knowledge and skills that we can learned from each other. It doesn't matter how young or old you are there is always something to be learned, especially when people have vastily different interests and expertise in specific subjects.</p>
                <h3>Reduce Loneliness</h3>
                <p>When you think of everything that has happened in recent years, loneliness continues to be at the forefont, causing negative impacts for several generations. 1 in 3 adults have reported experiencing loneliness due to the decrease in social interactions. The effects can greatly increase the rise for mental and physical health problems. By creating another resource to in communities for more social interactions, it fights to deminish the loneliness epedmic.</p>

            <h1>Diving into the Design</h1>
            <h4>Working with two audiences on opposite ends up the spectrum, there was an emphasis to design a project that would visually pull them in and attract them to continue to explore what the program can offer them.</h4>

                <h5>Golden Joy is the nickname of the flower Coreopsis, which are known for their reliability due to long blooming periods and their rich yellow-orange coloring.</h5>
                <p>Finalizing the name acted as the first step towards create a solution as it helped to establish a theme that continued to carry over into other components within the project, especially when it came to the design of the logos. </p>

            <div class="brand-logo-info">
                <p>Exploration was an important part of this project as I tried to figure out how I wanted to include the coreopsis. The process started out with some rough sketches of an abstract flower and ended with the realization of wanting to design a logo that is modular, abstract, and geometric.</p>
                <p>Through trials and errors, a polished verison of the logo came together supporting the original concepts that help convey the message of the project centered around connections and building friendships. While also, creating a strong visual foundation to build upon as the project expands and grows. The inspiration from the coreposis is captured once again in the logos help to establish visual accessibility as the plum pops against the golden orange.</p>

            <h2>Patterns</h2>
            <div class="brand-patterns-info">
                <p>Playing around with the modular design of the logo icon, I felt the branding could be developed further through the creation of a pattern. I wanted to design a pattern to act as an additional component that would be easily recoginizable across all assets. The patterns felt like an important extension of the brand as it works to be another representation of the connections built and expanded upon by those who participate in the project.</p>
                <p>Originally, I printed off copies of the "flower pedals" to play around with different shapes and forms. Ulitmately, the patterns were brought to life through Illustrator and polished into what you see below. To differenate between the primary and secondary patterns, I pulled inspiration from the diamond shape in the middle of the "o", as seen in the logo, as a way to have set design components that could be ulitized not only together in a pattern, but could stand alone to be used in a varieties of ways in the designed assets.</p>

                <h2>Outreach</h2> 
                <p>In the midst of research, I came across Generations Connect and ended up connecting with Anabelle Sanchez, who is a student at Michigan State University and is actively involved in this program. Similarly, Generations Connect is a volunteer program to help build intergenerational connections between college students and seniors in the community.</p> 
                <h3>Main Takeaways</h3>
                <p>Both participants are required to fill out a form to note they are interested, when they are available to meet, and how often they would like to meeet.</p> 
                <p>Resulting in a email being sent out to inform both parties they have been matches and are given each others contact information.</p>
                <p>The program host social events as a way for students and seniors to meet inperson, and provides the opportunity for seniors who may not know each other to meet as well.</p>

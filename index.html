    <div class="problem-statement">
        <h5>As people grow older, what were once simple tasks become more time-consuming and more difficult to complete. Unfortunately, friends and family members aren't always readily available or within driving distance to help as much as they would like. Ultimately, this opens the door for the opportunity to grow and strength intergenerational relationships by leaning on the support of younger members of local communities such as high school and college students, to assist with tasks like house or yard work, technological needs, or running errands.</h5>

        <h5>With such a generational divide, how can younger generations connect with older adults to assist them with tasks, enabling them to retain their independence while also increasing community involvement?</h5>

    <div class="problem-statement">
        <h5>As people grow older, what were once simple tasks become more time-consuming and more difficult to complete. Unfortunately, friends and family members aren't always readily available or within driving distance to help as much as they would like. Ultimately, this opens the door for the opportunity to grow and strength intergenerational relationships by leaning on the support of younger members of local communities such as high school and college students, to assist with tasks like house or yard work, technological needs, or running errands.</h5>

        <h5>With such a generational divide, how can younger generations connect with older adults to assist them with tasks, enabling them to retain their independence while also increasing community involvement?</h5>

        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <div class="inspiration-info">
            <div id="img-grandparents"><img src="img/grandparents.jpeg" alt="Grandparents"></div>
            <p>Both sets of my grandparents are in their late 80s/early 90s and up until recently lived indepedently and quite far from myself or other relatives. While they have since moved closer to family, they still don't want to hand over their independence by moving into assisted living or a retirement home, and who could blame them. Over the years, I have become more aware of the challenges they face with complete simple tasks whether it dusting or challenges with technology. <br>While this is not an uncommon occurrance, it caused me to think about how there could be a way to have their local commmunity offer help, leading me down the path of how to involve younger generations like high school or college students, and ultimately reenforecd the overarching theme of this project <em>Intergenerational Connections.</em><br></p>

        <h2>What are intergenerational connections? And why are they relevant?</h2>
        <div class="research-benefits">
            <h3>Strength Community Relationships</h3>
            <h3>Never Stop Learning</h3>
            <h3>Reduce Loneliness</h3>
        </div>
        <p>The basic idea of intergenerational connections revolves around building relationships with people of a different age group then yourself. With this type of connection, people are actively taking the time to build connections in their communities with groups that they might not have much interaction with otherwise. In terms of this project, there is not much overlap between 18-23 years old and those who are 60+ years old.</p>
        <p>There are also social, political, and economoic impacts that commonly create divides between generations. But by removing that precedent it creates space for more inclusive practices to grow within local communities as people look beyond to see there is one seamlessly simple similarity. The personal skills and knowledge people within each generation have.Everyone has knowledge and skills that we can learned from each other. It doesn't matter how young or old you are there is always something to be learned, especially when people have vastily different interests and expertise in specific subjects.</p>
        <p>When you think of everything that has happened in recent years, loneliness continues to be at the forefont, causing negative impacts for several generations. ADD MORE INFO</p>

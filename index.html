                <h1>The Spark</h1>
                <p>Both sets of my grandparents are in their late 80s/early 90s, and up until recently lived indepedently and quite far from myself or other relatives. While they have since moved closer to family, they still don't want to hand over their independence by moving into assisted living or a retirement home, and who could blame them. Over the years, I have become more aware of the challenges they face to complete simple tasks whether it dusting or technology troubles. </p>
                <p>While this is not an uncommon occurrance, it caused me to think about how there could be a way to have their local commmunity offer help. Leading me down the path of how to involve younger generations like high school or college students, and ultimately reinforecd the overarching theme of this project intergenerational connections.</p>

    <div class="problem-statement">
        <h1>As people grow older,</h1>
        
        <h5>what were once simple tasks become more time-consuming and more difficult to complete. Unfortunately, friends and family members aren't always readily available or within driving distance to help as much as they would like. Ultimately, this opens the door for the opportunity to grow and strength intergenerational relationships by leaning on the support of younger members of local communities such as high school and college students, to assist with tasks like house or yard work, technological needs, or running errands.</h5>

        <h4>With such a generational divide, how can younger generations connect with older adults to assist them with tasks, enabling them to retain their independence while also increasing community involvement?</h4>
    </div>

    <div class="research">
        <h1> Initial Research</h1>
        <h2>What are intergenerational connections? And why are they relevant?</h2>
        <div class="research-benefits">
            <div class="research-data">
                <h3>Strength Community Relationships</h3>
                <p>The basic idea of intergenerational connections revolves around building relationships with people of a different age group then yourself. With this type of connection, people are actively taking the time to build connections in their communities with groups that they might not have much interaction with otherwise. In terms of this project, there is not much overlap between 18-23 years old and those who are 60+ years old.</p>
                <h3>Never Stop Learning</h3>
                <p>There are also social, political, and economoic impacts that commonly create divides between generations. But, by removing that precedent, it creates space for more inclusive practices to grow within local communities, as people look beyond to see there is one common similarity. The skills and knowledge individuals within each generation hold. Everyone has knowledge and skills that we can learned from one another. It doesn't matter how young or old you are, there is always something to be learned, especially when people have vastily different interests and expertise in specific subjects.</p>
                <h3>Reduce Loneliness</h3>
                <p>When you think of everything that has happened in recent years, loneliness continues to be at the forefont, causing negative impacts for several generations. 1 in 3 adults have reported experiencing loneliness due to the decrease in social interactions. The effects can greatly increase the rise for mental and physical health problems. By creating another resource for social interactions in communities, it works to deminish the loneliness epedmic.</p>

            <h1>Diving into the Design</h1>
            <h4>Working with two audiences on opposite ends up the spectrum, there was an emphasis to design a project that would visually pull them in and attract them to continue to explore what the program can offer them.</h4>

                <p>is the nickname of the flower Coreopsis, which are known for their reliability due to long blooming periods and their rich yellow-orange coloring.</p>
                <p>Finalizing the name acted as the first step towards create a solution, as it helped to establish a theme that continued to carry over into other components within the project, especially when it came to the logo designs. </p>

            <h2>Branding</h2>
            <div class="brand-logo-info">
                <p>Exploration was an important part of this project as I tried to figure out how I wanted to include the Coreopsis. With the variations, mulitple concepts where tested from incorporating the flower pedals, introducing harder lines, sharper edges to playing with more fluid and abstract designs. The process started out with some rough sketches of an abstract flower, and ended with the solidifing a logo design that is modular, abstract, and geometric. In the logo icon, there is a nod to the diamond seen in the O's, to continue the harmony between the icon and type.</p>
                <p>Through trials and errors, a polished verison of the logo came together supporting the original concepts and helped to convey the message of connections and building friendships. While also, creating a strong visual foundation to build upon as the project expands and grows. The inspiration from the coreposis is captured once again in the logos to establish visual accessibility as the plum pops against the golden orange.</p>

            <h2>Patterns</h2>
            <div class="brand-patterns-info">
                <p>Playing around with the modular design of the logo icon, I felt the branding could be developed further through the creation of a pattern. I wanted to design a pattern to act as an additional component that would be easily recoginizable across all assets. The patterns felt like an important extension of the brand as it works to be another representation of the connections built and expanded upon by those who participate in the program.</p>
                <p>Originally, I printed off copies of the "flower pedals" to play around with different shapes and forms. Printing and cutting out the pedals on paper was a personal preference, as I found it faster and easier to brainstorm when play around with the structure. Quickly, working through what looked too busy, how could it be more playful, inviting, or simplifted. Ulitmately, the patterns were brought to life through Illustrator and polished into what you see below. To differenate between the primary and secondary patterns, I pulled inspiration from the diamond shape in the middle of the "O", as seen in the logo, as a way to have set design components that could be ulitized not only together in a pattern, but could stand alone to be used in a varieties of ways in the designed assets.</p>

            <p>Introducing guidelines will help to keep the branding consistent across all platforms, and will be benefitical for partnerships down the line. The hope is communities will partner with Golden Joy to host event in their town, at local businesses, restaurants, and community centers. The guidelines are there to act as the dos and don'ts for the brand as it expands into multiple hands, walking through the logos, color palette, typography, patterns, and photography. The Brand Guidelines are relatively simple, keeping the language concise to negate the partners from misusing the brand and it's identity. </p>

            <h4>In order for people to learn about what Golden Joy is, hosting in-person events is an essential part of tailoring to both groups. Enabling them to hear first hand accounts of the experiences and benefits form from actively participanting.</h4>

            <p>This type of event is focused on providing outreach to seniors, as the events would be hosted at local businesses like cafes, restaurants, senior centers, etc. The goal is to create a face-to-face chance for seniors to learn about the Golden Joy program and hear how others have benefited, not only from the program, but from building intergenerational connections.</p>
            <p>Students are welcomed to join as well to get a chance to meet their community members. During the meet and greet, there would be brochures passed out to inform about the program and the steps on how to register when they get home. They would also be able to register at the event, if they don't have access to a computer.</p>
            <p>Another reason the community events are an important aspect of Golden Joy is due to how many people learn about events through word of mouth. As part of my research, I was able to meet with members, to fill out a survey, from the 55+ Club in Papillion, NE. The club is a senior center and a social meeting ground that provides activities everyday for members. Out of the 12 participants, more then half of them learned about the 55+ Club via word of mouth. Not to mention, 9 out 12, participants highly value their community, which helped to inform this component of the program. Ensuring that by hosting face-to-face events, people are able to physically participant in local events and share their experiences with friends, inviting them to join as well.</p>

            <p>Unlike to the Community Meet & Greets, the Activity Fairs are specificly targeted to high school and college students. The booths would be run by student ambassadors, who would be wearing Golden Joy volunteer shirts. By participanting at activity fairs, it gives other students the chance to hear first hand experiences from their peers, and provide them with the opportunity to sign up at the same time as their friends. To appeal to Gen Z and increase the number of participants, those who registered at the fair would recieve a Golden Joy canvas tote bag.</p>

                <p>In the midst of research, I came across Generations Connect and ended up connecting with Anabelle Sanchez, who is a student at Michigan State University and is actively involved in this program. Similarly, Generations Connect is a volunteer program to help build intergenerational connections between college students and senior citizens in their community.</p> 
                <h3>Main Takeaways</h3>
                <p>Both participants are required to fill out a form to note their interests, when they are available to meet, and how often they would like to meeet.</p> 
                <p>Resulting in a email being sent out to inform both parties they have been matches and recieve each others contact information.</p>
                <p>The program host social events as a way for students and seniors to meet in person, and provides the opportunity for seniors who may not know each other to meet as well.</p>

                <p>Reaching out to Anabelle, helped to inform that there would need to be specific pages for each target user to nagivate through. Specifically, when it came to requesting for the program and what their dashboards will look like. The process of creating the user journey laid out each page both users (yellow), the student volunteers (orange), and senior citizens (green) will interact with.</p>
                <p>Both groups go through the same registration process, but the content on specific pages will vary. For the volunteers, the highschool/college students, they will input what tasks they would like to help with and are the ones accepting the task requests made by the seniors. On the other hand, those who are in need of assistance will enter what tasks they like help with, but will be notified when a volunteer accepts their request.</p>

            <p>There are three pathways within the website. The registration, located on the homepage for easy access, is the first step for users start the process for creating intergenerational connections. Within the registration, there is the task request where both volunteers and those who needs assistance will enter what tasks they would like to receive help with and what they would like to volunteer for. Once they have finished the registration process, there are steps outlining what to do next, prompting them to explore their dashboard. This is where they can view upcoming meetings, submit new tasks, create new matches, view messages within the browser, and edit their profile.</p>

            <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
            <p>Reflecting on the current support provided to older generations, there is more work to be done to shine a light on programs that help reinforce the importance of giving back. Where a sense of community is established and can provide a strong enough foundation for people to lean on one another, especially senior citizens. Relying on the support from family members or friends isn't always a option. Depending on the size of the community, resources to older generations can be very limited. Programs like Golden Joy can fill that gap, and help older generations maintain their independence, working to reach the smallest community much like the one my grandparents are from which have about 1,000 residents.</p> 
            <p>To work on a project of this scale, has provided me with such valuable knowledge that came through trials and errors. The target audiences need to be kept at the forefront of any design project. Truly understanding the user became helpful when it came to decision making. Keeping in mind what is going to be most benefitcal for the users vs what choices might hinder their nagivation or interaction with the brand/project. Especially, when trying to balance usability and creating an appealing design for two vastly different target audiences. </p>
            <p>All of this started from a small idea that got ignited when I was driving back home from a week-long visit with my grandparents. In that moment, more than a year ago now, I started to process how could they could they can help from their community when family and friends aren't always around to help. It is truly insane how a quick thought based on a personal experience can snowball into a concrete concept that could be solved through design and transform into a full-fledged project. Building intergenerational connections between two unlikely generations to not only create community service opportunities, but help senior citizens maintain their independence.</p>
